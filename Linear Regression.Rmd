## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Statistical Learning
## 2.3.1 Basic Commands
### functions to perform operations
#### using <- 

x <- c(1, 3, 2, 5)
x


#### using =
x = c(1, 6, 2)
x

y = c(1, 4, 3)
y

#### check length
#### length X
length(x)
#### length Y
length(y)

#### x+y
x+y

#### ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects
ls()
#### rm() function can be ls() used to delete any that we don’t want
# rm(covax_new_data)


#### remove all objects at once
#rm(list = ls())  #remove all objects at once

#### ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects
ls()

# Matrix
?matrix

#### create a simple matrix.
x <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
x

#### we could just as well omit typing data=, nrow=, and ncol= in the matrix() command above
x <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)

#### Alternatively, the byrow = TRUE option can be used to populate the matrix in order of the rows.
matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)


#### The sqrt() function returns the square root of each element
sqrt(x)

#### The command x2̂ raises each element of x sqrt() to the power 2;
x^2

#### The rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables, with first argument n the sample size.
x <- rnorm(50)
y <- x + rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = .1)
cor(x, y)
